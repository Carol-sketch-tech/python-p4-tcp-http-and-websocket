all internet communication relies on the internet protocl and transmission control protocl 
IP indicates how messages are senf between networks on the internet.
it is upheld by nealry all internet based applications 


TCP 
where ip is focused on messaged TCP is fcused on connections.
it is a stateful protocol meaning that id remembers previous transactions for the durarion of the connetion.

TCP takes a message an breaks into smaller pieces called packets.
each packet contains a part of your message and some addtional information.

TCP adds some speial information to each packet it inlcudes the adress of hte sender and the adress of the reciever.

TCP also numbers each packet in order.
it is like labelling the packets with numbers startigin from one so your frined
can put them back together correclty 
TCP takes part in the transport layer of hte networing stack 

when the receiver computer gts the packets TCP comes into action again 
it check if any packets are mission or got damaged during the journey 
if that happends TCP asks the sernder to send thise mission or damages packets again
this sensures that the reciever get all the packets 

TCP is concidered stateful
because it establishes a connection, keepts track ifthe ongoig commuinication unitl the conversation is complete.
this statefulness allows for efficient and error-free data transission over the internet
